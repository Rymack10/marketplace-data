Machine-readable data about health insurance marketplaces and enrollment. Because anything is better than a PDF. Here's to hoping that HHS makes this repo unnecessary soon.

## Current files
* County and 3-digit zip crosswalk to rating areas. Includes state and county FIPS codes for analysis and fixes misspellings and duplications present in the original data.
 * Data source: http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-Market-Reforms/state-gra.html

## Coming soon
* ASPE enrollment reports
